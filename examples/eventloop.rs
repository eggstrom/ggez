//! This example demonstrates how to roll your own event loop,
//! if for some reason you want to do that instead of using the `EventHandler`
//! trait to do that for you.
//!
//! This is how `ggez::event::run()` works, mostly, (if you want to see which parts were left out
//! of this example, check [event.rs](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/src/event.rs),
//! it really is not doing anything magical.  But, if you want a bit more power over
//! the control flow of your game, this is how you get it.
//!
//! It is functionally identical to the `super_simple.rs` example apart from that.
